# COS40007 Design Project

COS40007 students are expected to undertake a design project on a focused topic of AI for Engineering. Students will receive sample datasets, and may also collect similar data independently. More details on the projects will be discussed in Week 4 and 5 seminars.

---

## A. Grouping Rules

- Groups must contain 4â€“5 students.
- Groups must be formed within the same studio session unless special permission is granted.
- If you've changed studio sessions, inform your tutor.

**Group deliverables:**

- Project Brief  
- Data Labelling  
- Data Exploration & Pre-processing  
- Model Training and Validation  
- Model Evaluation  
- AI Demonstrator  
- Project Presentation  
- Final Report  

---

## B. Rubric, Report, and Project Progress

- Rubric available mid-semester.
- Final report outline released after mid-semester.
- Studio sessions post mid-semester will be used to review progress.

---

## C. Project Topics

- Apply AI knowledge to a selected engineering problem.
- Develop a project brief and plan.
- You may choose your own tech stack.

---

## D. Project Themes

Submit group members, student IDs, studio, and ranked preferences [via this form](https://forms.office.com/r/aBsdn1SNg9) by **noon, 7 April**. First preferences are not guaranteed.

### Theme 1: Smart City / Civil and Construction Engineering

**AI Areas:** Deep Learning, Object Classification, Anomaly Detection  
**Data:** Roadside images  

**Topic:** Detect roadside asset issues from vehicle-captured images (e.g., dumped rubbish, damaged signs).  

**Key Questions:**
1. What issue is detected?
2. What is the specific type of issue?

**Model:**
- **Input:** Image
- **Output:**
  - Identified issue + confidence score
  - Identified object + confidence score

**Data Source:**  
Contains images in folders: `rubbish`, `not_rubbish`, `damaged-sign3`.  
Annotate bounding boxes and label object types or damage types.
